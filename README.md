### Hi there, I am Unai ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Student in Statistics at the LMU Munich (Germany). Currently, I am working on two projects leveraging [multi-calibration and multi-accuracy boosting](https://mlr-org.github.io/mcboost/index.html) to improve statistical targeting procedures and survey inference. Generally, interested in enhancing reliability of (causal) ML for high-stakes decision-making.
